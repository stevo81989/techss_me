<h3>Welcome to my website</h3>
<br></br>
	<p>My name is Stephen Simpson. I currently work for WiredTree, a server management company specializing in web hosting based out of downtown Chicago. My job is to oversee the employees through two shifts and ensure a smooth transition with projects and issues through both. I work with clients through a web and phone based helpdesk system to ensure that their linux server is functioning perfectly.</p>
	<p>I currently hold a Bachelor of Science in network and Communications management from Devry University. While at DeVry I studied a wide array of technologies such as Cisco, Microsoft, Linux, IP Telephony, Virtualization and plenty more. Most of my time now, however, is focused on what else I can do to further my education in my career path. I presently hold a CCNA and I am looking to acquire certifications like the RHCSA as well as high level certifications including the CCNP.</p>
	<p>I hope this site provides as much information as possible and I would like to thank you for viewing!</p>
